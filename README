igb_uio - WEKA
--------------

This contains a version of igb_uio that has been modified
for use with WEKA software.  The original driver was extracted
from the DPDK version 18.11, and was authored by Intel and
licensed under the terms of the GPL 2.0.

It is anticipated that in the future WEKA software will
move towards using vfio that is bundled in modern Linux kernels,
at which point this driver will be obsolete.
